# Ejournal-2.0
Hello, my name is Artur, and I am excited to introduce my latest project. It's a Chrome extension that enhances our school diary experience. The primary issue with the school diary was dealing with unstructured data. In a nutshell, whenever I wanted to view all marks for a specific subject, I had to spend a lot of time scrolling through the website. Here is what I mean:

These photos show that to see my previous math mark, I have to go back to the previous week. It would be even more challenging to do this for a whole semester with hundreds of days. Additionally, finding out what each mark stands for is also a problem as you need to press the mark for that information

# How to use it
Download the extension from Google Chrome store and go to the diary's website (https://e-journal.iea.gov.ua/)

Just press the green button. Then the script will scroll the whole year. It is reccomended not to open other URLs so that the programm works properly.
When the programm is done you will see this table. Every table represents one month. Explore the previous month by simply pressing the arrow button.

# Why do we do this 
Personally, I (artur_bertash) advocated replacing the diary with another one. However, my idea unfortunately didn't receive the support I had hoped for.  To a certain extent, I understand the reasons behind this.  Instead of sitting around, we decided to make the best of the situation and developed a script to parse the diary's website and transfer the data to a table. While some may view this as spending too much time on a seemingly minor detail, we firmly believe it's worth the effort and will greatly improve the overall experience.
